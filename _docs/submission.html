      This article tells you how to submit your project to the Student Server Space, not how to deploy it. To deploy your code, read our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy/">Deployment Guide</a>, after submitting your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      To clarify, submitted projects do not need to be deployed (they can be hosted externally), but all deployed projects must be submitted.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Want to submit your project to us? Sounds good! Here's an article that outlines exactly how you would do that. Let's get started.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2 class="section-header" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Before you try to submit your project, make sure that you've checked off everything in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/content">Content Policy</a>. In addition, if you're also looking to deploy your project on Student Server Space, make sure it adheres to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/code">Code Policy</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In addition, you'll also need these tools to submit your project:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com">A GitHub Account</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, or a <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Git Client</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        A Text Editor (we recommend <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2 class="section-header" id="setup">Setup</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Let's setup your local development machine so you can make some changes! The first thing you're going to do is fork and clone the <a href="{{site.repo}}">Student Server Space Website repository</a> on GitHub, so you can work on it. Here's a photo that shows you what button to press:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/gh-fork.png" alt="Example of how to fork repository from GitHub." />
  <p class="lead">
    Now, you should have your own copy of the <code>website</code> repository. We're going to clone that to our computer. You can either do this from the command line, or through a Git client. Regardless, you'll need to press the "clone or download" button, represented in this image: with <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code>, or through a Git client, like GitHub Desktop. Here's a visual representation of how to open it in GitHub Desktop, from the GitHub website:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/gh-open-desktop.png" alt="Example of how to clone the repository from the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    If you want to clone it from the command line, type in <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> in your terminal, with <code>YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> being the link in that picture. If you'd like to open it in GitHub Desktop, simply press the "Open in Desktop" button.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-danger">
    <span class="text-danger"><span class="fa fa-exclamation"></span> Warning</span>
    <p>
      Make sure you're cloning your fork (version) of the <code>website</code> repository, <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/website</code>, not the one from the <code>studentserverspace</code> group. You can't edit that one!
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Now you should be ready to make some changes! From now on, we'll be working in the repository directory (wherever you cloned the repository). Get your text editor out, and let's get started!

  <h2 class="section-header" id="add-project">Adding Projects</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Adding your project to the Student Server Space directory requires you to make one (or two) files. First, we're going to make a new <code>YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.md</code> (markdown) file in the <code>_projects</code> directory. Then, we're going to add our YAML header: this is something specific to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, if you're interested. Here's an example template, for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/paleta/">Paleta.</a>

        Make sure your project has all the required header elements. If it doesn't, we'll deny your submission, no exceptions. You can always resubmit after making corrections.

    <p class="lead">
      Once you're done your header, the content of the <code>.md</code> file is a full description of your project. Make sure it's somewhat descriptive, since you're showcasing your project to everybody! Copying your GitHub <code>README.md</code> file is perfectly fine, as long as it's still descriptive. And remember, this is a public-facing site: ensure your description is appropriate for all ages!

    Now that you've added your project (and your creator file) to your repository, we're going to test them to see if they work, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. You'll need Ruby to use Jekyll, but that comes pre-installed on most unix systems.

      Installing Jekyll is super easy! Just type in <code>gem install jekyll</code> into your command line/terminal.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    We're now going to test your new code to see if it works! In the root directory of your project, or <code>/</code>, type in your command line <code>jekyll serve</code>. If your output looks something like this:

    Then it's working! If some error messages pop up, see if you can fix them yourself (google is a great resource). After having no compile errors, you can check out the website yourself. Visit the address that comes after <code>Server addrress</code> in your browser, and try checking the Projects Directory to see if your set up works as intended.

<div class="section">
  <h2 class="section-header" id="submit-projects">Submitting Projects</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Now that your project is submitted in your local repository, and tested, we're going to bring it up to speed with our main branch! Here's a graphical explanation of what we're doing in principle; after, we'll walk you through how to do it with Student Server Space.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/github-flow-cheatsheet.png" alt="A visual example of how GitHub, and Git, flows." />
  <p class="lead">
    The first thing we want to do is commit our changes to our remote branch on our fork. In other words, that means pressing that commit + sync button on GitHub Desktop, or doing <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push origin master</code> on your command line. After your fork repository is up to speed with your local development file system (you can double check this by visiting <code>YOUR-USERNAME/website</code> on GitHub), we're going to submit a Pull Request.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    A Pull Request sends your new changes, in your forked repository, and asks the main SSS website's repository to merge these changes. In this case, you'll do this through GitHub. Head to the "Pull Requests" section of your fork, and press "New Pull Request" button.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/fork-pr.png" alt="What the Pull Request tab looks like on the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    You should get a screen that looks like this:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/compare-pr.png" alt="What the Compare Pull Request screen looks like on the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    Press that "Create pull request" button. Now, you should be a screen like this:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/create-pr.png" alt="What the Create Pull Request screen looks like on the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    Fill out the paragraph description (it'll make things easier on us), and click "Create pull request"! And you're done! Wait until your pull request gets responded to: we'll either merge it, and put it on the website, or deny it, and let you know what you need to fix so it becomes mergeable.
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/success-pr.png" alt="A merged pull request on the GitHub website." />

    Ta-da! We're done!
