      This article tells you how to submit your project to the Student Server Space, not how to deploy it. To deploy your code, read our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy/">Deployment Guide</a>, after submitting your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      To clarify, submitted projects do not need to be deployed (they can be hosted externally), but all deployed projects must be submitted.
    </p>

    Want to submit your project to us? Sounds good! Here's an article that outlines exactly how you would do that. Let's get started.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Before you try to submit your project, make sure that you've checked off everything in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/content">Content Policy</a>. In addition, if you're also looking to deploy your project on Student Server Space, make sure it adheres to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/code">Code Policy</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In addition, you'll also need these tools to submit your project:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com">A GitHub Account</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, or a <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Git Client</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        A Text Editor (we recommend <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 class="section-header" id="setup">1. Setup</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Let's setup your local development machine so you can make some changes! The first thing you're going to do is fork and clone the <a href="{{site.repo}}">Student Server Space Website repository</a> on GitHub, so you can work on it. Here's a photo that shows you what button to press:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/gh-fork.png" alt="Example of how to fork repository from GitHub." />
  <p class="lead">
    Now, you should have your own copy of the <code>website</code> repository. We're going to clone that to our computer. You can either do this from the command line, or through a Git client. Regardless, you'll need to press the "clone or download" button, represented in this image: with <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code>, or through a Git client, like GitHub Desktop. Here's a visual representation of how to open it in GitHub Desktop, from the GitHub website:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/gh-open-desktop.png" alt="Example of how to clone the repository from the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    If you want to clone it from the command line, type in <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> in your terminal, with <code>YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> being the link in that picture. If you'd like to open it in GitHub Desktop, simply press the "Open in Desktop" button.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-danger">
    <span class="text-danger"><span class="fa fa-exclamation"></span> Warning</span>
    <p>
      Make sure you're cloning your fork (version) of the <code>website</code> repository, <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/website</code>, not the one from the <code>studentserverspace</code> group. You can't edit that one!
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Now you should be ready to make some changes! From now on, we'll be working in the repository directory (wherever you cloned the repository). Get your text editor out, and let's get started!

  <h2 class="section-header" id="add-project">2. Adding Your Project</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Adding your project to the Student Server Space directory requires you to make one (or two) files. First, we're going to make a new `YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.md` (markdown) file in the `_projects` directory. Then, we're going to add our YAML header: this is something specific to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, if you're interested. Here's an example template, for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/paleta/">Paleta.</a>
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>

    Confused by what those categories mean? No problem! Here's a nifty table explaining each element:

        Make sure your project has all the required header elements. If it doesn't, we'll deny your submission, no exceptions. You can always resubmit after making corrections.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">
      Once you're done your header, the content of the `.md` file is a full description of your project. Make sure it's somewhat descriptive, since you're showcasing your project to everybody! Copying your GitHub `README.md` file is perfectly fine, as long as it's still descriptive. And remember, this is a public-facing site: ensure your description is appropriate for all ages!
