    This article tells you how to submit your project to the Student Server Space, not how to deploy it. To deploy your code, read our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy/">Deployment Guide</a>, after submitting your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify, submitted projects do not need to be deployed (they can be hosted externally), but all deployed projects must be submitted.

    Want to submit your project to us? Sounds good! Here's an article that outlines exactly how you would do that. Let's get started.

    Before you try to submit your project, make sure that you've checked off everything in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/content">Content Policy</a>. In addition, if you're also looking to deploy your project on Student Server Space, make sure it adheres to our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/code">Code Policy</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In addition, you'll also need these tools to submit your project:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, or a <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Git Client</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github">A GitHub Account</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        A Text Editor (we recommend <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p class="lead">
    Let's setup your local development machine so you can make some changes! The first thing you're going to do is fork and clone the <a href="{{site.repo}}">Student Server Space Website repository</a> on GitHub, so you can work on it. Here's a photo that shows you what button to press:

  <p class="lead">
    Now, you should have your own copy of the <code>website</code> repository. We're going to clone that to our computer. You can either do this from the command line, or through a Git client. Regardless, you'll need to press the "clone or download" button, represented in this image: with <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code>, or through a Git client, like GitHub Desktop. Here's a visual representation of how to open it in GitHub Desktop, from the GitHub website:
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/submission/gh-open-desktop.png" alt="Example of how to clone the repository from the GitHub website." />
  <p class="lead">
    If you want to clone it from the command line, type in <code>git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> in your terminal, with <code>YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL.git</code> being the link in that picture. If you'd like to open it in GitHub Desktop, simply press the "Open in Desktop" button.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block">
    <span class="fa fa-exclamation"></span> Warning
    <p>
      Make sure you're cloning your fork (version) of the <code>website</code> repository, <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/website</code>, not the one from the <code>studentserverspace</code> group. You can't edit that one!
