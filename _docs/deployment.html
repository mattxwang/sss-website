    This article tells you how to deploy your project to the Student Server Space, not how to submit it. To submit your code, first read our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/submit/">Submission Guide</a> and submit your code, and then head back here to deploy it.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify, submitted projects do not need to be deployed (they can be hosted externally).

    This guide walks you through deployment on Student Server Space, or how to get your project up and running on our webserver.

    Before you deploy your project to Student Server Space, make sure that you've checked off everything in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/content">Content Policy</a>, and our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/code">Code Policy</a>. If part of your project doesn't adhere to these guidelines, we cannot accept it for deployment.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    In addition, we need your project to contain all the files necessary for deployment: <a href="https://github.com/studentserverspace/project-boilerplate">this repository</a> contains an example of each file required, and a detailed description of each.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Finally, check that your project is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/supported/">supported by Student Server Space</a>. As we're still developing a lot of the functionality in SSS, it's possible that your project isn't supported yet. Once you've checked off all of these things, you're ready to go!
