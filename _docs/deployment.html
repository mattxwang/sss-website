    This article tells you how to deploy your project to the Student Server Space, not how to submit it. To submit your code, first read our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/submit/">Submission Guide</a> and submit your code, and then head back here to deploy it.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify, submitted projects do not need to be deployed (they can be hosted externally), but all deployed projects must be submitted.
