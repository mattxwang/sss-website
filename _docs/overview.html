    Hey there! You're probably reading this documentation site because you want to do something related with the Student Server Space, and that sounds awesome! Here, we have pages that tell you how to submit a project, deploy a project, manage the server, and everything in between. Plus, you'll find a set of policies and guidelines that make clear what's allowed on the Student Server Space, and what isn't. You can find all of this information on your sidebar. We'll also answer some common questions about SSS.

  <p class="lead">
    The Student Server Space is a set of resources and a community to help student developers grow. In particular, there are two features that are discussed in this documentation. Firstly, student developers can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/submit/">submit</a> a project to SSS for it to be featured on the SSS website. This gives projects more exposure, and can also invite others to help develop the project. Secondly, student developers can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy/">deploy</a> a project to an SSS webserver. This allows students to get a domain and hosting for free, which is often expensive for students to accquire. To do either of these actions requires a set of restrictions, which is outlined in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/code/">code</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/content/">content</a> policies.

    If you want to use SSS, I suggest you check out our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/submit/">submission</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy/">deployment</a> guides, which walk you through the process of making your own projects!

    If you're just wondering about the technology behind SSS, we'll get back to you on that.
