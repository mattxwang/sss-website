    Want to submit an awesome project? Great! But, you need to make sure that your content adheres to our code policy. Let's learn about it in this article!
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Student Server Space, first and foremost, is a testing ground for students to get their projects up and running. But we also want to make sure that your code is well designed, works properly, and is easily accessible for others to learn from. That's why we have this code policy; here's a brief idea of what our code policy means.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open-sourced software
    </li>
    <li>
      Well-designed, well-maintained, and secure code
    </li>
    <li>
      Easily deployable
    </li>
    <li>
      Written in <code>HTML/CSS</code>, <code>JS</code> (and node), <code>PHP</code>, or <code>Ruby</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      Content-Controlled
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="lead">
    What do those mean exactly? We'll explain in these next few sections.

          <td>
            Code should be well-designed, and follow general coding practices. While we won't outright deny your code on this factor alone, it will play into whether or not it is accepted. There are resources in the "code design" section of this guide to help you out.

          <td>
            Code needs to be well-maintained; if there are large bugs in the software that are not fixed within a month, it will be taken down. In addition, if there is time-relevant information that is not updated, we will give you a warning, and possible probation.

            Code security is extremely important; we will vet your code for most common security holes, but any code that poses a security threat (or allows security threats through) jeopardizes the SSS system, and will be denied/removed.

            <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/paleta">Paleta</a> is a front-facing static site; <a href="https://world.ac/">WAC</a> has dynamic elements, but those elements are not front-facing.

<div class="section">
  <h2 class="section-header" id="source-code">Source Code</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    All of your project's code should be open-source. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">According to Wikipedia</a>, open-source is defined as:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    ... computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
  </blockquote>
  <div class="card card-block">
    <span class="fa fa-star"></span> Reasoning
    <p>
      We require open-source software for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in principle that open-source software is beneficial: you're giving back to the community, allowing other people to learn from your work, and foster collaborative development. Open-source is becoming more and more popular in the workforce, and we want to make the transition easy for you. The second reason is that it makes integration very easy for us: we can view all of your source code easily, and deploy it even easier.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    For simplicty, we also require your code to use a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git-based</a> implemenation of open-source. Git makes version control very easy, and also makes your own code cleaner and manageable.
  </p>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Want some examples of ways to go open-source, with Git? Our main recommendation is <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which is a free, git-based, open-source website and program. We use GitHub for <a href="{{site.repo}}">this website</a>, as well as the majority of our projects. GitHub is very easy to use, has an amazing amount of resources, and a great community to help you get started. If you want to learn more about Git and GitHub, check out our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resources/learn-git">page on learning to use Git.</a>
