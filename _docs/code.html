    Want to deploy your amazing project? Great! But first, your code needs to work with our code policy, or else we can't deploy it.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Student Server Space, first and foremost, is a testing ground for students to get their projects up and running. But we also want to make sure that your code is well designed, works properly, and is easily accessible for others to learn from. That's why we have this code policy; here's a brief idea of what our code policy means.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open-sourced software
    </li>
    <li>
      Well-designed, well-maintained, and secure code
    </li>
    <li>
      Easily deployable
    </li>
    <li>
      Written in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/supported/">supported languages</a>

    What do those mean exactly? We'll explain in these next few sections.

    Your project must be open source, no exceptions.

      Open source software is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
    </p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">- Wikipedia</a>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    We require open-source software for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in principle that open-source software is beneficial: you're giving back to the community, allowing other people to learn from your work, and foster collaborative development. Open-source is becoming more and more popular in the workforce, and we want to make the transition easy for you. The second reason is that it makes integration very easy for us: we can view all of your source code easily, and deploy it even easier.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    For simplicty, we also require your code to use a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git-based</a> implemenation of open-source. Git makes version control very easy, and also makes your own code cleaner and manageable.
  </p>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Want some examples of ways to go open-source, with Git? Our main recommendation is <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which is a free, git-based, open-source website and program. We use GitHub for <a href="{{site.repo}}">this website</a>, as well as the majority of our projects. GitHub is very easy to use, has an amazing amount of resources, and a great community to help you get started. If you want to learn more about Git and GitHub, check out our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resources/learn-git">page on learning to use Git.</a>

  <p class="lead">
    Spiritually, Student Server Space is about education through community. Or, as My Little Pony puts it, "sharing is caring". Because of that, and also because of <i>just how awesome</i> open-source is, <b>we require all submitted projects (and all deployed projects) to be open-sourced</b>, and have an open-source license to account for that.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-primary">
    <span class="text-primary"><span class="fa fa-book"></span> Definition</span>
    <p>
      An <b>Open-source license</b> is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified and/or shared under defined terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license">-Wikipedia</a></small>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Your license should be clearly stated somewhere in your project, either on the project's website, or in the root directory of the project (as a <code>LICENSE</code>, <code>LICENSE.md</code>, or <code>LICENSE.txt</code> file).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We're not going to tell you what specific license you need to choose, but there are a few common ones that we'd recommend (specifically the <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a> and <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/"?>Apache</a> Licenses).

      Student Server Space's website is under the MIT License. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/studentserverspace/website/blob/master/LICENSE">here.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Not having a License will mean we will deny your project, and likewise having a closed-source license will also get your project denied. If you have any more questions about licensing, feel free to ask us!

  <p class="lead">
    Concepts like good code design (e.g. clean functions) and practice (e.g. commented code) are important to making awesome projects! While we cannot force you to create well-designed code, it will be a factor in whether or not your project will be accepted. Since Student Server Space is all about education, we have an emphasis on helping student developers learn mistakes in their code, and fix them for the future.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    To reiterate, it's not possible for us to have a complete list of good versus bad code design and practice, but we can give you a few concepts that we encourage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Commented and documented code
    </li>
    <li>
      Human-readable code
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-redundant, clean functions
    </li>
    <li>
      No unused variables
    </li>
    <li>
      Standards complaint (e.g. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Introduction_to_HTML5H">HTML5 Doctype</a>)
    </li>
    <li>

  <h2 class="section-header" id="code-maintenance">Code Maintenance</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Code Maintenance, in this specific case, is purely based on responding to administrative requests, and ensuring your project is functional. This isn't a prerequisite, but rather an acknowledgement that you have committed to maintaing your project on SSS. This has two types of required maintenance. Firstly, if your project is not functional (broken) for an entire month, we reserve the right to take it down until it is functional again. Secondly, if you do not respond to administrative requests (mostly about following other rules properly), we will take down your project indefinitely.
