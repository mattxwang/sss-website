    Want to submit an awesome project? Great! But, you need to make sure that your content adheres to our content policy. Let's learn about it in this article!

    Student Server Space, first and foremost, is a testing ground for students to get their projects up and running. It's designed for everybody to use it in good spirit, but we need a set of guidelines to clarify what is allowed and what's not. Generally, here's what we're looking for in our submissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open-sourced software
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-commercial use
    </li>
    <li>
      Content-Controlled
    </li>
    <li>
      Equitable and Legal
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="lead">
    What do those mean exactly? We'll explain in these next few sections.

    Spiritually, Student Server Space is about education through community. Or, as My Little Pony puts it, "sharing is caring". Because of that, and also because of <i>just how awesome</i> open-source is, <b>we require all submitted projects (and all deployed projects) to be open-sourced</b>, and have an open-source license to account for that.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-primary">
    <span class="text-primary"><span class="fa fa-book"></span> Definition</span>
    <p>
      An <b>Open-source license</b> is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified and/or shared under defined terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license">-Wikipedia</a></small>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Your license should be clearly stated somewhere in your project, either on the project's website, or in the root directory of the project (as a <code>LICENSE</code>, <code>LICENSE.md</code>, or <code>LICENSE.txt</code> file).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We're not going to tell you what specific license you need to choose, but there are a few common ones that we'd recommend (specifically the <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a> and <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/"?>Apache</a> Licenses).

    <span class="text-success"><span class="fa fa-info"></span> Fun Fact</span>
    <p>
      Student Server Space's website is under the MIT License. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/studentserverspace/website/blob/master/LICENSE">here.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    Not having a License will mean we will deny your project, and likewise having a closed-source license will also get your project denied. If you have any more questions about licensing, feel free to ask us!

  <h2 class="section-header" id="commercial">Commercial Policy</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Student Server Space is here to get developers up and running on their side projects, but we aren't here to provide a mechanism to cut costs on student business. While we do like the idea of commercial projects, our infrastructure isn't designed for commercial projects. Therefore, <b>we do not allow commerical projects on Student Server Space.</b>
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-primary">
    <span class="text-primary"><span class="fa fa-book"></span> Definition</span>
    <p>
      We define commercial projects as any project that is designed to sell a product, service, or perform monetary transactions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    That being said, we do allow websites that display information about a product, but does not perform the monetary transaction on the site (e.g. mailing in a cheque). In addition, we also make a special exception for charity websites. If you have a question about our commercial policy, let us know: we are more flexible on this guideline, than, let's say, licensing.

<div class="section">
  <h2 class="section-header" id="content-control">Content Control</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    If your site collects data and/or displays data, there are a few sets of controls that we have to place on your data. Here's a table outlining them all:
  </p>
  <div class="table-responsive">
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Type

        <tr>
          <td>
            Content Display
          </td>
          <td>
            SSS Projects cannot have public-facing content that is user-editable. This includes anything a user of your website can see on your website, including messages, pictures, and code, from other parties. Private content can still be user-editable: a user can edit content that they themselves can see, but other users cannot.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Content Upload
          </td>
          <td>
            Users cannot upload files to the deployed webserver, period. If your project is deployed elsewhere (not on SSS), then users can upload content: but ramifications that arise from user uploaded content cannot be held accountable to Student Server Space.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Data Consent
          </td>
          <td>
            SSS Projects must make it clear what information they are storing. For example, if an email is required to register, then this does not need to be clarified further; on the contrary, if the application stores the user's IP, then this must be stated on the website.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Emails
          </td>
          <td>
            Deployed projects cannot use internal mail servers. In addition, any emails sent out by your project must be done so after the user has consented to receiving these emails (e.g. "I allow X to send me emails" checkbox). An exception is made for account creation emails, and account security emails.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Account Deletion
          </td>
          <td>
            If your project features an account system of any kind, there must be a mechanism that allows the user to delete the account fully from the system, with all related information removed. This could be a "delete account" button, an email to contact, etc.

  <h2 class="section-header" id="equity-legality">Equity and Legality</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    This section should be obvious, but your content should be equitable and legal. If it isn't <b>we'll terminate all of your projects</b>, and a warning; a repeat offense is an indefinite ban from the system. There isn't much else to it. Don't be unequitable, don't do illegal things.
  </p>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-primary">
    <span class="text-primary"><span class="fa fa-book"></span> Definition</span>
    <p>
      <b>Equitable content</b> is content that's inclusive for all. That means no discrimnation, hate speech, or treating any group of people unfairly. Need help figuring out whether or not your content is equitable? Ask an SSS member!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-block card-outline-primary">
    <span class="text-primary"><span class="fa fa-book"></span> Definition</span>
    <p>
      <b>Legal content</b> is content that abides to Canadian law. Examples of illegal content includes selling illicit materials, distributing child pornography, or inciting hate speech.
