    Student Server Space, first and foremost, is a testing ground for students to get their projects up and running. It's designed for everybody to use it in good spirit, but we need a set of guidelines to clarify what is allowed and what's not. Generally, here's what we're looking for in our submissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open-sourced software
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-commercial use
    </li>
    <li>
      Content-Controlled
    </li>
    <li>
      Equitable and Legal
    </li>
  </ul>
