    Student Server Space, first and foremost, is a testing ground for students to get their projects up and running. It's designed for everybody to use it in good spirit, but we need a set of guidelines to clarify what is allowed and what's not. Generally, here's what we're looking for in our submissions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Non-commercial use
    </li>
    <li>

            Code should be well-designed, and follow general coding practices. While we won't outright deny your code on this factor alone, it will play into whether or not it is accepted. There are resources in the "code design" section of this guide to help you out.

            Code needs to be well-maintained; if there are large bugs in the software that are not fixed within a month, it will be taken down. In addition, if there is time-relevant information that is not updated, we will give you a warning, and possible probation.

  <h2 class="section-header" id="source-code">Source Code</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    All of your project's code should be open-source. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">According to Wikipedia</a>, open-source is defined as:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    ... computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
  </blockquote>
  <div class="card card-block">
    <span class="fa fa-star"></span> Reasoning
    <p>
      We require open-source software for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in principle that open-source software is beneficial: you're giving back to the community, allowing other people to learn from your work, and foster collaborative development. Open-source is becoming more and more popular in the workforce, and we want to make the transition easy for you. The second reason is that it makes integration very easy for us: we can view all of your source code easily, and deploy it even easier.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    For simplicty, we also require your code to use a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git-based</a> implemenation of open-source. Git makes version control very easy, and also makes your own code cleaner and manageable.
  </p>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Want some examples of ways to go open-source, with Git? Our main recommendation is <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which is a free, git-based, open-source website and program. We use GitHub for <a href="{{site.repo}}">this website</a>, as well as the majority of our projects. GitHub is very easy to use, has an amazing amount of resources, and a great community to help you get started. If you want to learn more about Git and GitHub, check out our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resources/learn-git">page on learning to use Git.</a>
