  <p>
    Coding can look super scary, and it definitely can be! Simply put, programming is becoming a professional problem solver: whether it's solving a math question, figuring out how to best convey a message, or making your wildest dreams your reality! All you need to do is explain what you want to do, to your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two large elements to any sort of programming: <code>logic</code> and <code>syntax</code>. <code>Logic</code> is the thought process behind your code, or a set of steps the computer will follow to solve your problem. <code>Syntax</code> is the format this logic is placed in, very similar to grammar in any language.

    Here's a table of some of the most popular languages, though you certainly don't need to know all of them! Instead, pick 1 or 2 that fit what you're looking to make, and start from there. Plus, check out our sections in the sidebar for explanations and resources for each language!

    <p>
      One very common path is to learn Python, an object-oriented language, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is by no means the "correct" way to learn programming, but it covers a diverse set of languages, and can help you make almost anything!

  <h2 class="section-header" id="htmlcss">HTML and CSS</h2>
  <p>
    HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) are the core foundation to any website on the internet. HTML is used to structure and write content, such as this paragraph; CSS is then used to make this paragraph look good, through colours, fonts, spacing, and many others. While HTML and CSS aren't "real" programming languages, they're a good start into making awesome things with computers, and are a super useful skill to have.
