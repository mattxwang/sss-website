    If you ask any parent, teacher, or employer, one of the skills they value the most is organisation. Programming is no different: programmers value great code organisation, whether it be through coding practice, or "version control". This article will help you understand what <code>git</code> is, and how you can use it to make your code well organised, well documented, and super awesome. Let's get started.

  <h2 class="section-header" id="what">What is Git</h2>
  <p>
    Git is a software version-control system, or a system that keeps track of changes made to code over time. Git is extremely useful in software development, as it lets you organize your code well, and keep backups in case things go wrong. Plus, Git has branches, which let you switch between diffrent stages in your code. If you want to try out a new feature, you can! If your code breaks, no worries: swap back to an older verison, or your main branch. Plus, in contrast to other version-control systems, Git can be run locally, meaning you don't need a server to perform version control.

  <h2 class="section-header" id="github">What is GitHub</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is an online implementation of Git, primarily designed for open-source projects. Basically, GitHub makes version control with Git easier, for free! It also comes with lots of features for online code collaboration, and support for lots of coding operations (such as continous integration). There's also a large community on GitHub, where you can look at some super awesome open-source projects, help out, and receive some help! Plus, they give you free stuff through <a href="https://education.github.com/">GitHub Education</a>, which is super awesome.
