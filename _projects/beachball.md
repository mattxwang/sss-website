# Beachballâ›±

Like pastebin, but expiries are based on visits. Say you set expiry to one hour, if no one visits it within an hour, then it goes away. But every time someone visits it, that hour gets renewed. Perfect for all those times a sensitive chunk of text needs to get passed around, but it's hard to co-ordinate exact times.

## Setup

Setup is dead simple.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksarick/beachball.git # clone the repo
cd beachball # go to the folder
mkdir db # the the database directory
npm start # start the server
```

Boom. Done. Your server is now up, running, and fully configured at <http://localhost:8080>.

If you want HTTPS, run `./gen-cert.sh`, and change `use_ssl` in `config.json` to `true`. It will be self-signed, so you'll need to add `localhost` as an exception for most browsers.

When you make some changes and want to see if your general layout works, run `npm test`. It won't check everything, but it should cover some basics. Yes, I wrote the test in TCL, it's a good language.

## Customizing
To change the port, the location of stored text files, or the location of webpages, edit `config.json` as you see fit. SSL should be pretty straight forward, but I haven't done much testing. If you don't like my pages (I'm not exactly a designer, I know), go to the `pages` directory and edit whatever you like. You'll notice a big difference: The server can't handle file requests. No including css files via requests. In exchange, I've implemented an include system. Any file in `<<< >>>` will be "imported". For example:

**`main.html`:**

```html
<div>
	<<< mixin.html >>>
</div>
```

**`mixin.html`:**

```html
<b>I'm some content</b>
```

`main.html` will output:

```html
<div>
	<b>I'm some content</b>
</div>
```

When called. Coolio!

I added another cool templating feature. Things wrapped in `{% raw %}{{{ }}}{% endraw %}` will be swapped for their corresponding variable.

**`main.html`:**

```html
<h1>{% raw %}{{{ title }}}{% endraw %}</h1>
<div>
  {% raw %}{{{ content }}}{% endraw %}
</div>
```

In the server, you might have something like:

```javascript
compose("main.html", {"title": "Hello!", "content": "More stuff here"})
```

Which would output:

```html
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<div>
	More stuff here
</div>
```

The whole system is designed to be mostly painless an intuitive on the surface. To make any actual changes will require actual code. Sorry.
