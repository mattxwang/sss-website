## The World Affairs Conference Website

Hello there! Welcome to the repository for the World Affairs Conference (WAC).

## What is WAC?

According to our website,

> The World Affairs Conference (WAC) is Canada's oldest annual student-run current affairs conference.

WAC is an annual event where thousands of students in Ontario gather to hear some of the brightest minds in Canada (and in the world) discuss important current affairs topics, such as technology, politics, and ethics.

## What Does This Website Do?

Good question! This website displays information about WAC for delegates, advisors, and speakers. Hopefully, we make it easy for all of you to learn about what exactly WAC is, what it's about, when it is, and all those other useful tidbits of information.

In addition, we also do registration through the website (though that source code will be closed-source, for now). It makes it easier for advisors to register for WAC, and also means we cut down less trees. Awesome!

## Development Notes

So you want to contribute to WAC? Great! We're aiming to have a full documentation set on how to edit this website, but in the meanwhile, we have a little guide for you.

### Quick Pointers

* Our production-ready version of the website is stored in `stable`, which is available for viewing at [world.ac](http://world.ac).
* All other branches are not officially available on the web. Instead, you'll have to build and run them yourself. Refer to our setup section for more information.

### Setup

*Note: This guide assumes you're using a unix system. If you aren't (e.g. Windows), this setup method is currently unsupported, but we'll come up with one soon*.

Setup is dead simple. If you can cut and paste commands, you can have it up within minutes.

First thing you need is the repository. Clone it with this command:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/malsf21/world.ac.git &&
cd world.ac
```

To setup your machine to run the server, you'll need the tools of the trade. The tools we use are:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), to run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), to build and run the website
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), to write CSS better
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/), to clone this repository
* A Browser, to view the website of course!

If you're using a UCC computer, Ruby comes pre-installed. That makes installing our dependencies pretty easy! (If you don't have ruby installed, you can find instructions [on their website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)). To install `jekyll` and `sass`, our two ruby dependencies, simply type:

```bash
sudo gem install jekyll sass
```

It will ask you for your password, just so it can install things properly. Once it's done, you're ready to build!

Next step is to setup the server. Just run `./setup.sh`. Boom. Done.

To actually see the website, run `start.sh`. Visit what follows the "Server address:" line (which is normally [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/), but that might change soon)!

**TL;DR:** copypaste this into Terminal:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/malsf21/world.ac.git &&
cd world.ac &&
./setup.sh &&
./start.sh
```

*Note: On `dev`/`master` branches, it might be be `127.0.0.1:4000/wactest/` or `127.0.0.1:4000/wac/`, but on `stable` branches it will most likely be just `127.0.0.1:4000`. Double check just to be sure!*

And voila! Everything should work for you. If something isn't, please let one of us on our [issues tracker](https://github.com/malsf21/world.ac/issues).
